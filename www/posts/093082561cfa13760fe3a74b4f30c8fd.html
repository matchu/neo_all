<div class="post-content">
  With the plot possibly coming to a close either today or within the week, there's a question that still remains on everybody's mind: how will we get one of those fab new magma pets?<br /><br />Obviously, the first possibility is a paint brush. However, there's some speculation as to other possible methods, namely, a special magma pool.<br /><br />Similar to the Rainbow Pool in Faerieland, it's thought that the magma pool below might be a bit special, especially in regards to our pets.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.jellyneo.net/images/newsup/moltara_magma_pool.png" /></center><br />There are also two items released within the past week that describe the "secrets" and "magic" of a magma pool...<br /><br /><center><a href="http://items.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=item&amp;showitem=35855"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/mall_mme3b1_grant_c3urj.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><b>MME3-B1: Magma Pool Background</b><br /><i>This fiery pool is quite magical...</i><br /><br /><a href="http://items.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=item&amp;showitem=35836"><img src="http://images.neopets.com/items/mcb_discovmagmapool.gif" border="0" /></a><br /><b>Discovery of the Magma Pool</b><br /><i>Learn the myths, legends and tales of how the magma pool was discovered and its secrets.</i></center><br />The questions we have so far:<br /><ul type="square"><li>Will there be a magma paint brush?</li><li>If no PB, is the magma pool a possibility?</li><li>How will we get access to this hypothetical magma pool?</li><li>Will access to the pool be a final plot prize only?</li><li>Or, will there be some new faerie quests similar to the Fountain Faerie Quests?</li></ul><br />What are your thoughts on everything?
