<h1>Editorial #113: 1+1&#8800;3</h1>
<div class="post-content">
  <img src="http://images.neopets.com/template_images/grundo_fire.gif" /> Hello! I'm <b>Polemarch</b>, one of the programmers here at Jellyneo. In addition to patching up old code whenever something breaks, my job is to, well, program new features. And apparently do an editorial every so often whenever I run out of stuff to program, which you can obviously tell since I'm... doing an editorial. How creative I am. <br /><br />In this issue, we'll be exploring things such as the Test of Strength jackpot, why the Blue Buzz Plushie doesn't exist, and the spaceship zooming around Neopia. <br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorial&amp;issue=113">SELECT * FROM `editorial` WHERE `issue`=113</a></center><br /><br /><b>Important Notice:</b> The editorial will now run once every two weeks instead of once every week. This means that the next issue will be out on December 12th. On the off weeks, we'll instead be having JN feature spotlights where we spotlight a feature on JN, and you can offer feedback about it. :)<br /><br />For Issue 114, your questions will be answered by <b>Grog</b>, so send them in <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorial_ask">over here</a>. Please make sure that your questions aren't already in the <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorialdb">Editorial Database</a>, or on our list of banned questions. Furthermore, nicely formatted questions (including correct spelling, capitalisation, etc.) do increase your chance of getting a response. :)<br /><br /><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif" /> <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=games_master_2009">Games Master Challenge Guide</a> <img src="http://images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/star.gif" /></center><br /></div>
