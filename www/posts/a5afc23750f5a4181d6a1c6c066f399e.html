<div class="post-content">
  Nickelodeon, the owners of Neopets and a branch of Viacom, has signed on a company named PlaySpan to manage all of the microtransactions that occur across their network of sites. In the case of Neopets and Petpet Park, they'll be managing all of Neocash purchases that you make online.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/ncmall/neocash_10.png" /></center><br />There likely won't be any changes for those who already purchase Neocash, however, PlaySpan will be able to offer users 80 different ways across the globe to purchase Neocash. So, if you haven't been able to purchase Neocash in a normal way, this new deal likely means you'll be able to now.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/29/playspan-strikes-deal-with-nickelodeon-to-power-microtransactions/">Tech Crunch</a></div>
