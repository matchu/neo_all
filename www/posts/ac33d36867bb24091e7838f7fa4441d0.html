<h1>The Gamesmaster Challenge is On!</h1>
<div class="post-content">
  We had some doubts that the Gamesmaster Challenge would be happening this year in its usual November time slot since the current site event could have conflicted. However, the latest Neopets news email confirms it!<br /><br /><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nnmail/09_11/slot_3.jpg" /><br /><i>Games Master Challenge starts on November 24th. Can you beat AAA this year? Also, Lulu returns with her own challenges. Sharpen your gaming skills and get ready!</i></center><br />This likely means that the Atlas of the Ancients event will be finished, or wrapping up within the next three weeks. If you haven't completed all of the challenges yet, we suggest you <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=atlas_of_the_ancients">get going</a>!</div>
