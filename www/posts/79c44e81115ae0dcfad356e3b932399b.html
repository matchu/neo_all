<div class="post-content">
  <img src="http://images.neopets.com/template_images/arkmite_sneaky.gif" />I've never done a news post before. How exciting.<br /><br />Hello there, I'm <b>Scissors</b>, and I look after the <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=petdir">Pet Directory</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=newrainbowpool">Rainbow Pool</a> here at Jellyneo. I've been a staff member for a year and a half, but I have never been brave enough to do an editorial. With the help of my favourite faerie, I'm attempting one now. :)<br /><br />To see me and the Bucket Faerie discuss Atlas of the Ancients games, the mysterious Wishing Well and what Ukalis have for feet, <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorial&amp;issue=112">click here now!</a><br /><br />Next week's editorial will be answered by one of our talented programmers, <b>Polemarch</b>. You can send in a question <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorial_ask">right here</a>. Make sure you check our <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorialdb">Editorial Database</a> first, though. :) <br /><br /><b>Domain Sale:</b> For those of you who are interested in running a website, we have a domain name for sale. If you'd like to purchase <b>shenkuu.net</b>, we'd love to sell it. :) Please send your offers directly to dave at jellyneo dot net.<br /></div>
