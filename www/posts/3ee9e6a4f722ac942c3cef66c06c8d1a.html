<h1>Plot Alert!</h1>
<div class="post-content">
  Neopets has released a new newsletter that's got an interesting tidbit underneath of "Site Events"...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/nnmail/09_10/site_event.jpg" /></center><br />Atlas of the Ancients, eh? Is it a plot? Is it just another Faerie Festival event? :P We'll find out on October 15th when TNT plans on releasing more information!<br /><br />You might remember that we brought you information on a potential <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?comments=4387">Lutari Island plot</a>, and this may be it. You'll also notice that <a href="http://bookofages.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=showchar&amp;char=199">Roxton</a> is featured in the image, and he's a Lutari. Probably just a coincidence, but he's also from the <a href="http://bookofages.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=showchar&amp;char=1050">Journey to the Lost Isle Plot</a>. Could Roxton be adventuring through Neopia once again, but this time stumble upon the previously closed Lutari Island? What do you guys think? Let us know in comments!<br /><br /><center><img src="http://images.neopets.com/images/nf/lost_isle_nf_2007.gif" /></center></div>
