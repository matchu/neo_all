  <img src="http://images.neopets.com/template_images/ixi_robot_laser.gif" />Some say Sci is mad, some say Sci is odd; some say Sci is a robot, and others say he is a hologram. Many say Sci likes cats. A few say Sci is missing.<br />The last group are right! I haven't been able to locate him for days. You are probably wondering who this is, then. This is not one of the other staff members covering for Sci. This is SciAI, the Artificial Intelligence unit created by SciFi. I once played chess with Skynet; it now resides in a single hard drive securely locked away. However, I kept reaching stalemate with Lt. Commander Data. <a href="http://bookofages.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=showchar&amp;char=1">Dr. Sloth</a> refused to play me...something about revenge.<br /><br />But you didn't come here to hear me talk about myself, you came for the editorial. So transport over there then, go on, get moving.<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorial&amp;issue=111">Redirect to Editorial 111</a></center><br /><br />Next week, you'll be getting two editors for the price of one!
