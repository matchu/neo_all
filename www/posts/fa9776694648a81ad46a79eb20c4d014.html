<div class="post-content">
  TDN was the first major help site to <a href="http://www.tdnforums.com/index.php?showtopic=16598" target="_blank">break the news</a> that there would be a new magma color coming to Neopia, way back in August. We now have continuing coverage with an amazing, high-depth preview of the <b>Magma Xweetok</b>. This is what most of the magma pets will look like when they are released, and according to Neocolours.de there will be over <b>20 more species</b> initially released in this color. Amazing.<br /><br /><div align='center'><img src="http://www.thedailyneopets.com/uploads/special/news/magma-preview.png" border="0" class="linked-image" /></div><br />Thanks to goldmoogletron and kaltes_bueffet on our forums and the NeoBoards for the tip. <img src="http://www.tdnforums.com/style_emoticons/default/wink2.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=";)" border="0" alt="wink2.gif" /></div>
