<h1>Help JN Stay Alive</h1>
<div class="post-content">
  <b>Update:</b> We just want to thank you guys for all of your help thus far... you've all been extremely generous! :D In fact, we're almost half way there already!! In case you missed it from earlier, here's our post again.<br /><br />Hey guys! You might have noticed that JN hasn't had the best uptime lately. That's mainly because we're low on funds, and running JN on the private server we have costs a big chunk of change. We know not everyone has money to spare, but if you'd like to send a few bucks our way to help pay the hosting bills, please check out our new <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=donate_to_jellyneo">donation page</a>!<br /><br />It costs about $1,500 a year to keep JN up. We make absolutely no money from running the site, and we've relied solely on visitor generosity over the years. However, that generosity only gets us so far. Therefore, we have set a goal to raise $1,500 for 2010 so that we can have much more uptime and you guys will always have access to our services. :)<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.jellyneo.net/content/thermometer.php?goal=1500%C2%A4t=805" /><br /><i>We'll get there... eventually!</i></center><br />This is also how we've remained the <b>#1 ad-free Neopets help site</b> on the web! If you're interested in helping us to maintain that status, all of the details are on that aforementioned <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=donate_to_jellyneo">donation page</a>.<br /><br />Also, if you're under 18, don't have PayPal, or just don't want to send money to a group of wackos running a website, no problem! JN will continue to remain 100% free for anyone who visits. :)<br /><br /><!--<b>Survey:</b> We've also set up a nifty survey through Google to get your input on some of our most popular features. We want to make sure that our departments and services meet your needs; if they don't, please tell us how we can improve them. If you have 10-15 minutes to spare and you'd like to make JN better, then <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHVBSF9jaF95aWNySE40dG5yUTRNc3c6MA">click here to take the survey!</a>--><br /><center><a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=atlas_of_the_ancients&amp;id=day07">Step 7 Atlas of the Ancients Guide</a> | <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=tangorsworkshop">Moltara Petpet Guide</a></div>
