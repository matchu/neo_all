I'm here today to present you with the 110th Editorial! In it, you'll find pleasant questions about omelettes, Fish Neggs and beaches. But do not expect to find pleasant answers, for they are partitioned with Dismal Displays of Dancing, Fountain Faerie Cosplays, and Censored Customisation Closet Malfunctions! Follow me as I go head to head in a Neo-trivia duel with my doppelganger, <a href="http://bookofages.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=showchar&amp;char=1885">Rosie</a>!<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorial&amp;issue=110">Continue on to Editorial 110!</a></center><br />Next week, the editorial will be answered by the great and powerful <b>SciFi</b>!<br /><a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/index.php?go=editorial_ask">Send in your questions today!</a><br /><br />Don't forget to check the <a href="http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=editorialdb">Editorial Database</a> first, though. We don't mind pointing out some things that have already been published, but we'd like to answer unanswered questions, and if you can find what you're looking for in another editorial, you don't have to wait until we answer it, so everybody wins!<br /></div>
